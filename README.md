# Luckywheel
Luckywheel module in html, css, and javascript
I made a lottery wheel module that works on web pages written with html. The main part of the module is [javascript](./app.js) which is designed to generate and spin the lottery wheel in SVG format. This assumes that there is a web page with an input form SVG element.

### Usage:
Write the words in the input box, separating them with a new line. When you have finished adding words, press the Keeruta button, which will make the lottery wheel spin.
